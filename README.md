#### Current competitors 

- [ ] Lollipop Smart Baby Monitor
- [ ] Vtech 
- [ ] Baby factory

Even with the above competitors there is currently no monopoly in the market. 

#### Problems with current baby monitors: 

- [ ] Battery life of parent unit
- [ ] Connection range
- [ ] Camera quality and screen resolution
- [ ] Does not connect via wi-fi
- [ ] Signals may dirupt when too far from bedroom
- [ ] Settings get too complicated to adjust
- [ ] Hackers may access the device
- [ ] Safety of baby monitors/hacking
- [ ] Loss of signal
- [ ] Works like a walky-talky radio 
 
 #### Current solutions to above problems that already exist: 
 
 Unsuccesful apps that link to baby monitors 






#### Our solutions to above problems,  including purpose, three key features, how it will be built.
Describe your product/service clearly. Make sure that people understand from the description what it is and what it does. Use a drawing to help explain.
Describe your product or solutionâ€™s X-Factor (unique value proposition).  - Search market to see if there is something that does the moitoring and functional and aesthetically pleasing 


Smart baby is an unitrusive and functional smart device.
Key features for our product include:
- [ ] Light functions
- [ ] Sound functions 
- [ ] teaching and blutooth capabilities
- [ ] wifi connections.

Our physical device will have the ability to connect to a funtional app on the parent(s) phone(s). Feeback we have recieved is that with an app you can't use your phone normally. Our solution to this probelm would be to have the app working in the background. The parent would have a push notifcation come through when there is a distrubance wiithin the childs room.
