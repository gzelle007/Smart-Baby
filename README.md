Our physical device will have the ability to connect to a funtional app on the parent(s) phone(s). Feeback we have recieved is that with an app you can't use your phone normally. Our solution to this probelm would be to have the app working in the background. The parent would have a push notifcation come through when there is a distrubance wiithin the childs room.
