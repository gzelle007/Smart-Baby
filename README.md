- [ ] Lollipop Smart Baby Monitor
- [ ] Vtech
- [ ] No monopoly in the market. Each baby monitor that I've researched prior to purchase had their strengths and weaknesses

- [ ] Vtevh 
- [ ] Baby factory 
- [ ] Nature baby
- [ ] Uniden

- [ ] Signals may dirupt when too far from bedroom
- [ ] Settings get too complicated to adjust
- [ ] Hackers may access the device
- [ ] Safety of baby monitors/hacking

Smart baby is an unitrusive and functional smart device.
Key features for our product include light funtions, sound functions, teaching and blutooth capabilities and wifi connections. 
Our physical device will then have the ability to connect to a funtional app on the parents phone(s). Feeback we have recieved is that with an app you can't use your phone normally. Our solution to this probelm would be to have the app working in the background. The parent would have a push notifcation come through when there is a distrubance wiithin the childs room.
